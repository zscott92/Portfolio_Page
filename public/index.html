                        Hi, I'm Zach...I like all things computers, any and all music, and venturing into the great
                        outdoors.
                        So to be brief, I recently graduated from Georgia State University with a degree in Computer
                        Information
                        Systems.
                        Currently, I am enrolled in Georgia Tech's Web Development Bootcamp with the intention of
                        improving my
                        programming skills and expanding my technical expertise. I am now entering the job search stage,
                        and I welcome
                        any, and all inquries. Shoot me a text, email, or phone call...always free to chat with some
                        fellow nerds! All the best...your friend, Z!
                    </p>

                            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tphorton14/EnvironmAtlanta" target="black">Recycling App</a>
                            </li>
                            <p>For this app, our project team decided to take on a topic that was bigger than ourselves
                                ...we decided to make an app that would help better our environment around - thus
                                calling it EnvironmentAtlanta.
                                We used a mixture of jquery, vanilla javascript, sequelize for the database design, and
                                an express framework for the routing. I was charged with creatiing the news feed page,
                                and it's styling.
                                I took my design inspiration from graffiti art I had been walking by recently at the
                                krog street bridge. For the data aspect, I used an API
                                which esentially scraped various news sources using key word to, hopefully (key word),
                                come up with relevant topics involving the environment with a
                                specific emphasis on recycling news</p>

                            <li><a href="https://zscott92.github.io/Animingle/" target="_blank">Anime Dating App</a>
                            </li>
                            <p>For this application, our project team, (which consisted of the "legendary" Will West,
                                and the " truly one of kind" Kevin Abrams)
                                drew insipiraton from our lonily lives as being single middle-aged nerd...so with that
                                in mind, we
                                wanted to create an application that combined our love of anime with filling the void of
                                our said lonliness.
                                We set out to create an application that based upon the users facial profile character
                                (open-source API face++) that derived
                                a person's intrinsic characteristics (such as a confidence rating, and
                                happiness/solemness) to determine suitable anime matches
                                that fit the profile attributes. This was determined through our proprietary algorithim
                                (all credits to JS wizard, Will West).
                                We gave the user a variety of choices of anime matches (similar to what you would see on
                                your typical dating app)...from there
                                we allow the user to schedule times that the anime character is available to chat,
                                integrating with google calendars for scheduling.
                                Next, using a variety of chat bot personality types we allow the user to chat with
                                fairly realistic chat bots that allow the user to
                                fill the void of the lonliness that the app's creators fill on a nearly daily basis...
                            </p>

                                    For tune chains (yes, pun intended), our group mixed the ideas of open source
                                    software, copyright enfringement,
                                    and collaborative audio editing to make something that we felt provided the user
                                    with the best aspects of each.
                                    To create the legend that became Tune Chains was not an easy process with set backs
                                    along. In fact, this writer,
                                    in a bout with sleep deprivation and programmer's block (yes, a real thing), was
                                    unable to deliver on the lofty asipirations
                                    for what this project was an wasn't. As issue that I face as a programmer is where
                                    to draw the line between what's realistic
                                    and what I would like to see the app do...so after missed deadlines, frustrating
                                    experiences with AWS, and lack of clear directions
                                    (...I'll take some of the blame for that), our group was able to overcome the
                                    obstactles to make something that I feel is a truly
                                    remarkable ode to our varied inspirations...hope you enjoy playing with the app as
                                    much as we did making it!
