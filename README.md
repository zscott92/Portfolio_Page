My page...I'll give you some info about what I've been up to and current job deliverables including resume, linkedin, and links to heroku deployments of highlighted projects. For the design I took inspiration from this old deep red, almost purplish sweatshirt that I own -- and kind of used that as a starting point for the portfolio, adding colors along the way.
