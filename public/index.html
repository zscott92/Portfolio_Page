                            outdoors.
                            So to be brief, I recently graduated from Georgia State University with a degree in Computer
                            Information Systems. And after finishing my degree enrolled in and graduated from Georgia
                            Tech's Web Development Bootcamp and have greatly
                            improved my programming skills and expanded my technical expertise. I am currently job
                            searching,
                            and I welcome any, and all inquries. Shoot me a text, email, or phone call...I'm always free
                            to chat with some
                            fellow nerds (no, but seriously anyone and everyone, feel free to reach out !!) All the

                            <p>For this app, our project team wanted to take on a topic that was bigger than ourselves
                                ...so, we decided to make an app that addresses envrionmental causes that hope to better
                                our local environment around - thus, we named it EnvironmentAtlanta (big on puns).
                                For this project, we used a mixture of jQuery, plain/vanilla javascript, sequelize for
                                database, and
                                an express framework for the routing; along with a few api connections to pull in data.
                                For this project, I was charged with the creation of the news feed page,
                                and its styling.
                                I found inspiration for the
                                aesthetics from graffiti art that I had the day previosuly been walking by at the
                                krog street bridge (if you haven't checked it out, a must). In order to collect the data
                                from various news feed, I implemented an API
                                called NewsApi that scraped news sources by key word to
                                come up with relevant news topics involving the environment with a
                                specific emphasis on recycling.</p>

                            </li>
                            <p>For this application, our project team, (which consisted of Will West,
                                and Kevin Abrams, along with myself)
                                drew insipiraton from our lonily lives as single middle-aged nerds. So we decied with
                                decided to create an application that combined our love of anime while attempting to
                                fill the void of countless hours spent programming alone on our computers (I'm
                                semi-kidding, really all very cool guys, but you get the point)
                                We set out to create an application that used the users facial profile characteristics
                                (API name, face++) that was able to use
                                a person's intrinsic characteristics (such as a confidence rating, and
                                happiness/solemness, excitement, etc.) to determine suitable anime matches passed upon
                                our proprietary matching algorithim
                                (have to defer all credits to JS wizard, Will West).
                                We were able to give the user a variety of choices of suitable anime matches (similar to
                                what you would find on
                                your typical dating app)...and from there the user is able to schedule available times
                                (google calendar) to converse with said character.
                                Next, using a manipulated chat bot (Microsoft Azure Cloud), we were able to allow the
                                user to chat with someone who is non-biased and discreet.
                                Although the app is admittedly silly in nature, it allowed us to use an eclectic mix of
                                cutting-edge technologies -- we also had a great deal of fun styling it so I hope you
                                enjoy!

                            <p>For the liri node app, the objective was to show off some skills using nodejs to query APIs bandsintown, spotify, and rottentomatoes. This allowed the user the opportunity to find out when their favorite artist will play next, or
                                 find out more information about their favorite song, or find out more information about one of their favorite movies. This app allowed me to display some of my experience firuring out some the nuances of working with REST Api's. I enjoyed querying the necessary data by
                                 implementing Ajax requests to retrieve a user's input requests. Although the app has no pretty front-end (command line app). It was one of those special moments for me when I was filming me inputting the data and getting the requests. It was one of those moments when things really clicked! Wacth and enjoy (p.s. I tried to speed things up a little!!)</p>

                                For Tune Labz, it combines some ideals of open
                                source
                                software by incorporating a version-control tracking system (visualize a GUI representation of a branch (parent-child relationship) that splits as many times as the users wants to be able fork a version of any track of their choice by resubmitting the track, and then the program checking for discrepencies in audio frequencies) This is a place where creatives
                                can take their work, and put it out there and have others simple mess-around with it(professionally or just goofing off) and allow the user to put their own unique twist on it. In phase II, Tune Labz will allow for collaborative audio editing, by implementing sockets.io to provide the users with real-time feedback and interaction with other musicians.
                                During the creation of this app, there were quite a few set-backs
                                along the way (switching database technologies -- started with MySQL(didn't seem like a good choice, but probably doable) => and then switched to MongoDB (for user login and track lineage) and S3 (for audio blob) => and most recently switched to DynamoDB (for lineage and tracks info) **has better integration with S3). I was admittedly experiencing a bout of programmer's block when I started (yes, a real
                                thing!), and thus, adjusted project scope. I
                                think the thing I learned most from this project is that no matter what,
                                you are going to face obstactles during any project you start (especially when there's not a pre-set, cookie cutter method for how to build it). And ultimately, it's how you handle that adversity, and view it as a learning experience instead of a defeat. In summary, I have been attempting to rebuild this project from the ground up for the last month or so. I'm greatful for it though, because it's pushed me outside of what I was comfortable attempting (promoting growth). Although at the time of writing, no, this app is not ready to show off. Tune Labz has taught me more about expermenting with the MERN (SERN/DERN) stack and JS than any of my other projects combined.
                                (MERN, for the non programmer's is: MongoDB, Express, React, and nodeJS) But that's merely semantics  	&#x1F609;
