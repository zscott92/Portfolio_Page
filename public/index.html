                        Hi, I'm Zach...I like all things computers, any and all music, and venturing into the great
                        outdoors.
                        So to be brief, I recently graduated from Georgia State University with a degree in Computer
                        Information Systems. And after finishing my degree enrolled in and graduated from Georgia Tech's Web Development Bootcamp and have greatly
                        improved my programming skills and expanded my technical expertise. I am currently job searching,
                        and I welcome any, and all inquries. Shoot me a text, email, or phone call...I'm always free to chat with some
                        fellow nerds (...but seriously anyone and everyone feel free to reach out!) All the best...your friend (or very soon to be), Z!

                            <p>For this app, our project team wanted to take on a topic that was bigger than ourselves
                                ...so, we decided to make an app that addresses envrionmental causes that hope to better our local environment around - thus, we named it EnvironmentAtlanta (big on puns).
                                For this project, we used a mixture of jQuery, plain/vanilla javascript, sequelize for database, and
                                an express framework for the routing; along with a few api connections to pull in data. For this project, I was charged with the creation of the news feed page,
                                and its styling.
                                I found inspiration for the 
                                aesthetics from graffiti art that I had the day previosuly been walking by at the
                                krog street bridge (if you haven't checked it out, a must). In order to collect the data from various news feed, I implemented an API
                                called NewsApi that scraped news sources by key word to
                                come up with relevant news topics involving the environment with a
                                specific emphasis on recycling.</p>

                            </li>
                            <p>For this application, our project team, (which consisted of Will West,
                                and Kevin Abrams, along with myself)
                                drew insipiraton from our lonily lives as single middle-aged nerds. So we decied with decided to create an application that combined our love of anime while attempting to fill the void of countless hours spent programming alone on our computers (I'm semi-kidding, really all very cool guys, but you get the point)
                                We set out to create an application that used the users facial profile characteristics
                                (API name, face++) that was able to use
                                a person's intrinsic characteristics (such as a confidence rating, and
                                happiness/solemness, excitement, etc.) to determine suitable anime matches passed upon our proprietary matching algorithim
                                (have to defer all credits to JS wizard, Will West).
                                We were able to give the user a variety of choices of suitable anime matches (similar to what you would find on
                                your typical dating app)...and from there the user is able to schedule available times (google calendar) to converse with said character.
                                Next, using a manipulated chat bot (Microsoft Azure Cloud), we were able to allow the user to chat with someone who is non-biased and discreet.
                                Although the app is admittedly silly in nature, it allowed us to use an eclectic mix of cutting-edge technologies -- we also had a great deal of fun styling it so I hope you enjoy!
                            </p>

                                    For Tune Chains (yes, all puns intended), our group combined some of the ideals of open source
                                    software, along with copyright enfringement protection,
                                    and lastly, collaborative audio editing, which allowed us to create an app that provided the user
                                    with the best aspects of each.
                                    During the creation of the app, there a few set-backs
                                    along the way. I was admittedly experiencing a bout of programmer's block (yes, a real thing!), and had to adjust scope and pivot slightly to something less extravagent. I think thing I learned most from this project is that
                                    you are going to face obstactles along the way, but it's how you handle adversity that defines you as a top-notch programmer.
                                    Overall, I think the application captures our varied inspirations and visions...and again, I hope you enjoy playing with the app and messing around with different features.
